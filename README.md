# Kaggle INGV Volcanic Eruption Prediction

## About

From October 2020 to January 2021, the Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) hosted a competition on Kaggle that tasked data scientists to predict when a volcano’s next eruption will occur by analyzing a large geophysical dataset collected by sensors deployed on active volcanoes.
